# 1. Introduction

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and data flow of a software system to handle functional and non-functional requirements efficiently. It ensures scalability, reliability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.

A well-designed system can handle millions of users, process requests with low latency, and recover gracefully from failures.

Key goals:

Handle growing user base efficiently

Maintain low latency and high availability

Ensure fault tolerance and consistency

Optimize cost and performance

# 2. Lifecycle of a Request

Understanding how a request travels through the system helps in designing each component effectively:

User Request: A user interacts with the application through a browser or mobile app.

DNS Resolution: Converts the human-readable domain name into an IP address using a global DNS infrastructure.

Load Balancer: Distributes the traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, authentication, and throttling.

Backend Processing: Handles business logic, queries databases, communicates with external services, and performs computations.

Caching Layer: Frequently accessed data is served from cache to reduce response time.

Database Access: Persistent data is retrieved or stored in relational or NoSQL databases.

Response: The processed data is sent back to the user through the API gateway and load balancer.

# 3. Core Components
3.1 DNS (Domain Name System)

Translates domain names into IP addresses.

Example: www.example.com â†’ 192.168.1.1

Can include CDN-based DNS for faster resolution globally.

3.2 Load Balancer

Distributes incoming traffic to backend servers.

Types:

Layer 4 (Transport Layer, TCP/UDP)

Layer 7 (Application Layer, HTTP/HTTPS)

Load balancing algorithms:

Round-robin, least connections, IP hash

Provides high availability and fault tolerance.

3.3 API Gateway

Central entry point for clients.

Responsibilities:

Authentication & Authorization

Routing to microservices

Rate limiting & throttling

Request/response transformation

Caching frequently requested responses

3.4 Frontend Servers & CDN

Frontend Servers: Render pages and serve dynamic content. Can be stateless for horizontal scaling.

CDN (Content Delivery Network): Caches static assets (images, CSS, JS) near users for faster delivery. Examples: Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront.

3.5 Backend Servers

Handle business logic and interact with databases, queues, and external APIs.

Stateless services are preferred for easy scaling.

Microservices architecture allows independent deployment and scaling of each service.

3.6 Database

Stores persistent data.

Types:

Relational (SQL): MySQL, PostgreSQL, supports ACID transactions.

NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, optimized for high throughput and flexible schemas.

Considerations: indexing, replication, sharding, consistency, backup strategies.

3.7 Cache

Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load.

Examples: Redis, Memcached

Types of caching:

Read-through / Write-through

TTL-based caching

Distributed cache for horizontal scaling

3.8 Object Storage

Stores large unstructured files (images, videos, documents).

Examples: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage

Provides high durability, scalability, and availability.

3.9 Message Queue

Decouples services and handles asynchronous processing.

Examples: RabbitMQ, Kafka

Useful for tasks like sending emails, processing analytics, or order processing in e-commerce.

# 4. Services to Scale the System

Distributed ID Generator: Provides unique IDs across servers (e.g., Twitter Snowflake).

Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse by limiting requests per user or service.

Notification Service: Sends push notifications, emails, and SMS to users.

Recommendation Engine: Suggests personalized content based on user behavior.

Analytics Service: Collects metrics for monitoring system health and user behavior.

Payment Service: Securely handles transactions and integrates with banking APIs.

# 5. Design Principles

Scalability: Horizontal (adding more servers) vs Vertical (upgrading hardware).

Availability: Redundant systems, failover strategies, distributed systems.

Consistency: Trade-offs using the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance).

Performance: Caching, load balancing, query optimization, CDN usage.

Security: Authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation.

Observability: Logging, metrics, tracing for debugging and monitoring.

# 6. Common System Patterns

Microservices: Independent services for modularity and scalability.

Event-Driven Architecture: Services communicate via events for decoupling.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Separates read and write models.

Sharding: Splitting databases to handle large datasets efficiently.

Replication: Copies of data to improve availability and fault tolerance.
